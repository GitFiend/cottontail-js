# TODO

- Create tests for creating and removing elements. Fix bugs where elements are created and not all removed
- Test object pooling performance
- Copy across meta properties and don't store the object. Try object pooling for Meta types
  - Try not hold onto children after render for all components? 
- Unhandled cases with fragments
- We now have children in the props. Is this a problem when setting attributes?
